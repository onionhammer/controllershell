ControllerShell Replacement Shell
=================================

ControllerShell is a simple menu system designed to replace your Windows shell and allow users to navigate between consoles and games with only their gamepad (i.e. no need for a mouse and keyboard).

Configuration
-------------
ControllerShell is highly configurable. You can change the font, font size, title, colors, emulators, and search paths. Follow the sample **settings.ini** for guidance.

OSX and Linux Support
-------------
Linux and OSX should work, however I have only tested on Windows (8.1) and OSX.
